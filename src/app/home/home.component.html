      <p>
        As a seasoned <strong>Project Tech Lead Developer</strong> with a strong focus on Java, Angular, and Full-Stack development, I specialize in designing and building scalable, cloud-native applications. With extensive experience in both backend and frontend technologies, I have successfully led multiple projects, contributing at every stageâ€”from designing and developing applications to migrating them from on-premises infrastructure to cloud-native platforms, including <strong>Kubernetes</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        My expertise extends to managing complex, high-priority projects while leading a cross-functional team of <strong>15+</strong> members, ensuring smooth day-to-day operations, timely deliveries, and optimal collaboration. I am dedicated to providing leadership and technical guidance to ensure the success of each project.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I am committed to driving innovation and technical excellence, consistently delivering high-quality solutions that meet business goals and customer needs. My approach emphasizes continuous improvement, strong communication, and a focus on delivering value to stakeholders and end-users alike.
